<h1> Implementing a Virtual Machine Using Microsoft Azure </h1>
This tutorial outlines the steps to create Virtual Machines within Azure .<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

- <h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

**1.) First Login to your Microsoft Azure account and click on "Resource Groups" then create a resource group and name it**

**2.) Then go back to the home page of azure and click on Virtual Machines and create**

**After that we will be on the next screen where you put in the Resource Group we just made and change the operating system to "Windows 10" then name your virtual machine**

**Then proceed with the appropite size I will choose 2 vcpus because I will be creating another VM for the next project**

**And after all that just make a log in for VM and accept and agree with the TOS and click review and create. (*the rest will be fine on default settings*)**

**3.) Once this finishes deployment we can go ahead and click on go to resource and the virtual machine will be ready.**

**When we are on this screen we will bring up Remote Desktop and copy and paste the public IP Address for the VM onto remote desktop and hit connect.**

**Then type in your login information which we made in step 2**

**4.) Dont be alarmed when this pops up just click yes and proceed, from there we will be automatically logged in the VM and we can ignore or uncheck these privacy settings**

**5.)Finally we will be able to use our new VM we just created using azures virtual machine, From here we can do anything and test out projects and have fun playing around in a virtual machine without having to worry about harming our actually computer.**
