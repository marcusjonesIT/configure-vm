<p>
Step 1: Navigate to "portal.azure.com/#home" to create a Resource Group. You can either select Resource Groups from the home screen or at the top of the page you can search Resource Groups and select it from there. This will house the resources we're going to create (ex: The Windows VM we're creating).

<p>
Step 2: Click "Create" to create the Resource Group

<p>
Step 3: Select what Subscription you want the Resource Group to go into if you have more than one Subscription but we only have one so we will choose "Azure Subscription 1". Next you will name your Resource Group and for this Demo we'll just name it "VM-LAB01". From there select what region you want the resources to be created. Also some resources are not available in every region. So for this project we're going to create our resources in "(US) East US". Then at the bottom of the page click "Review + Create".

<p>
Step 4: Now that the Resource Group is created, we can begin creating our Virtual Machine (VM). From here you can either search Virtual Machines at the top of the page or you can go back to the Home page and select Virtual Machines from there. Click Create and select Azure virtual machine.
